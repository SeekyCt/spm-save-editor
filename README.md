# spm-save-editor
WIP editor for Super Paper Mario's wiimario0X save files

Currently just a command line demo that can read & edit a few values

If there's a field you'd like to be able to edit, feel free to create an issue / reach out to me on Discord (Seeky#4628) and I can quickly add it if I know how & where it's stored
